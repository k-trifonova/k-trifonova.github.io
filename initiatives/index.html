I managed and provided support to 20 students in lecture and lab settings, by creating and implementing weekly recitation lesson plans, devising grading rubrics, and grading homework, lab assignments, and course exams. I provided additional student support by holding twice-weekly office hours, review sessions, and creating supplemental learning material. My teaching efforts and contributions were recognized with the Physical Sciences Divsion Teaching Award in 2023/24, based on student nominations.
