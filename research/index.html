		<h2>Training many-to-many molecular networks</h2>
		<p>K. Trifonova, M. Falk, M. Elowitz, S. Vaikuntanathan, A. Murugan</p>
		<p>Can a single cell learn without neurons? Typically, we think that cells develop regulatory programs through evolution and, as such, have set responses for any environmental stimuli they have seen in their evolutionary history. In this theoretical work, we show that cells in structured environments can learn <em>new</em> regulatory programs within their lifetime using many-to-many molecular networks and gene autoregulation.</p>

		<h2>Using machine learning to predict reduced density matrices of molecules</h2>
		<p>L.H. Delgado, L.A.M. Sager-Smith, K. Trifonova, D.A. Mazziotti</p>
		<p>Can AI models trained on experimental data allow us to overcome the computational scaling problem of simulating many-electron systems? We develop a novel machine learning algorithm that trains neural networks on data about violations of N-representability conditions to approximate exact molecular energies as a convex combination of lower computational cost upper and lower bound energies.</p>
