		<h2>Training many-to-many molecular networks</h2>
		<p>K. Trifonova, M. Falk, M. Elowitz, S. Vaikuntanathan, A. Murugan</p>
		<p>Can a single cell learn without neurons? </p>
		<p>Typically, we think that cells develop regulatory programs through evolution and, as such, have set responses for any environmental stimuli they have seen in their evolutionary history. In this theoretical work, we show that cells in structured environments can learn <em>new</em> regulatory programs within their lifetime using many-to-many molecular networks and gene autoregulation.</p>

		<h2>Using machine learning to predict reduced density matrices of molecules</h2>
		<p>L.H. Delgado, L.A.M. Sager-Smith, K. Trifonova, D.A. Mazziotti</p>
		<p>Can AI models trained on data allow us to overcome the computational scaling problem of simulating many-electron systems? </p>
		<p>We developed a novel machine learning algorithm that approximates exact molecular energies as a weighted average of approximate upper and lower bound energies calculated with cheaper methods. The neural network is trained on data about violations of N-representability conditions, which can be calculated from reduced density matrices.</p>
